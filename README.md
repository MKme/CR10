# CR10
Files and settings from my work on the Creality CR10. General use print, vase mode for rockets and 3D Lab print profiles included.
Use the aircraft profiles with the 3Dlabprints.com planes. Profiles were developed for use with the Edge 540 aircraft. 

Some files are remixes from Thingiverse. Someday I'll get them posted there too.

Videos showing the results can be found here:
